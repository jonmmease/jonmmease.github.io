# Profile
I'm a problem-solver to the core with interest and experience across a range of
technical domains, algorithm families, programming languages, data visualization
techniques, and data science technologies.

I care deeply about the future of the open data science technology ecosystem,
I’m a contributor to a variety of open source data science projects, and I was
previously the Chief Scientist at Plotly.
