## Description
We describe our efforts to bring full ipywidgets support to the plotly.py 
data visualization library. This work brings many exciting new features to 
Jupyter Notebook users working with plotly.py including Python callbacks,
in-place figure updates, binary array serialization, and integration with the 
broader ipywidgets ecosystem.
