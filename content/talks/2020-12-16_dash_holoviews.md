## Description
With the release of Dash HoloViews, we are bridging the flexible data structure 
interface of HoloViews with the deployment scalability of Dash. Dash HoloViews makes
it possible to build certain classes of interactive Dash applications without the
need to manually define callbacks. This grants you the ability to automatically
link selections across multiple plots and to display large datasets using Datashader.
These can be implemented on top of pandas, Dask, or GPU accelerated cuDF DataFrames.
This feature's creator and Plotly's Chief Scientist, Jon Mease, will be hosting a
1-hour webinar to demonstrate how to use Dash HoloViews to simplify Big Data 
interactive visualizations.

During this webinar and AMA, Jon will show you how to:
 - Automatically set up linked selections in Dash apps
 - Visualize Big Data in Dash apps with Datashader
 - Combine Datashader and cross filtering
 - Add Mapbox support with zero callbacks
 - Use GPU accelerated Datashader and linked selections with RAPIDS
