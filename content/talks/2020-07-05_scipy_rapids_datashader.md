## Description
Datashader is a Python library for creating principled visual representations of large
datasets. This talk is a case study on the effort to add GPU support to Datashader 
using the RAPIDS project. In addition to discussing the performance benefits that were
attained, weâ€™ll cover a variety of design patterns that were used to maximize code 
reuse between the CPU and GPU code paths. This talk will be useful for anyone
interested in learning about how to incorporate RAPIDS technologies into their own
projects.
