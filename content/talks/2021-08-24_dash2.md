## Description
In this special webinar, Plotly's Chief Scientist and CPO will introduce Dash 2.0!

Dash 2.0 is a project to significantly expand the capabilities of the Dash callback 
decorator, introducing new concepts in Dash Labs such as Templates and Plugins that
enable powerful Dash apps with minimal lines of code, and simplifying the boilerplate
under unified imports. For brand new Python programmers, Dash 2.0 significantly
lowers the barrier of entry for quickly creating analytic data apps and GUIs. For 
advanced Dash programmers, Dash 2.0 provides a powerful new paradigm for code 
reuse-ability and share-ability.

In this webinar, Jon and Chris will cover:
 - How to simplify installation and imports with monopackages
 - How new callback enhancements increase flexibility
 - How to use long callbacks for caching â€” and scaling your work
 - How these community-led innovations make Dash Enterprise even more optimizied for production-grade development
