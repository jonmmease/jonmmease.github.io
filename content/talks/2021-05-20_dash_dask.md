## Description
Dash is a framework for developing analytic web apps in Python. This talk will 
describe Dashâ€™s design, and how it enables efficient scaling to support large 
numbers of simultaneous users. Then, several architectures will be presented that 
can be used to combine the strengths of Dash with the strengths of Dask Distributed 
to create apps that scale to support large datasets and many users.
