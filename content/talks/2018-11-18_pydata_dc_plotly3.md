## Description
We will discuss and demonstrate some of the exciting features that have been added to
version 3 of the plotly Python visualization library. These include ipywidgets 
integration for building ad-hoc dashboards in the Jupyter Notebook, support for
exporting publication quality static images, Latex integration, and more. We will 
conclude with glimpse into the future direction of the project.
