## Description
This webinar will introduce a new open source JupyterLab extension for editing 
Plotly charts through a user-friendly point-and-click interface. We will demonstrate 
how Python users can construct and save plots using plotly.py and then open and edit 
them using the new chart editor, all without leaving JupyterLab. We will cover how 
the chart editor can be used to style traces, legends, axis labels, fonts, annotations,
and more!
